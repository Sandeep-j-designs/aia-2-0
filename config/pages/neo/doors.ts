/**
 * When Neo can't do what was asked, it still knows what the request was
 * about. A request about TDS gets the TDS agent and routine; one about 2B
 * gets GST Reconciliation; one naming a vendor gets what Neo can do for that
 * vendor. The person leaves with a door, never only "I can't".
 *
 * Matched on the nouns of the trade, not on the words of Neo's examples:
 * the old fallback ranked examples by shared words, so "reconcile TDS
 * payable" was offered a GSTIN chase.
 *
 * DEV: with a model, the model writes this answer; the topics below become
 * the tool descriptions it can point at.
