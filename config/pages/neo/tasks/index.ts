 * Everything Neo can do in this prototype, in the order a tie is broken.
 *
 * Neo does the work no single screen can (Neo proposition, 14 Oct 2026):
 * ask the books, change by rule, chase and draft, and the day across
 * clients. Tasks that only pressed a button the screen already has —
 * approve a batch, sync, find duplicates, open the PO draft, explain a flag,
 * March provisions — were taken out; those live on their screens.
 *
 * DEV: this registry is the scripted stand-in for the model's planner. With a
 * model behind `POST /api/neo/runs`, the prompt goes to it with these as tool
 * definitions and this file is deleted.
