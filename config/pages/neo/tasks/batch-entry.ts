/**
 * Voucher entry in the chat: bills attached to a message, plus one line of
 * instruction, entered as a batch.
 *
 * The conversation is the plan's loop. Neo says what it understood from the
 * instruction (a settings card, editable in place), asks about each kind of
 * exception once, shows the purchase register to sign off (ticks, Dr/Cr per
 * row, totals reconciled to the documents), and only then makes the drafts —
 * Needs Review, prepared by Neo, tagged with the batch. Approving stays the
 * accountant's: in the Inbox, or from the follow-up Neo offers, which asks
 * again with the total in view.
 *
 * DEV: attachments go up with the prompt to POST /api/neo/runs; the batch
 * endpoints (types/pages/neo/batch.ts) are the tools this task calls.
