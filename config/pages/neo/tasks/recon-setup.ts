/**
 * Set up three-way reconciliation (20 Oct 2026). The brief's rule: read the
 * books before asking anything. Neo drafts the company's policy from three
 * months of vouchers (LRN-01), shows what it found with the evidence, asks
 * only what the books can't settle, refuses to copy a pattern that breaks a
 * hard rule, and the accountant approves the policy as version 1.
 *
 * DEV: GET /api/recon/policy/draft?company=… runs skill S3 over the synced
 * vouchers; POST /api/recon/policy approves it.
