                    Three layouts, and which one a route gets is decided by one
                    thing: whether its sheet draws the source document itself.

                    AP hands the whole width to its sheet, which is already a
                    document-beside-form split with its own splitter. Wrapping
                    it in a second split was what halved the form and tripped
                    its container query into folding every field into one
                    column.

                    AR's sheet has no document pane — standalone, an invoice is
                    raised rather than read off paper — but an inbox item always
                    has a file behind it, so the inbox supplies the preview and
                    the sheet takes the rest. Resizable rather than fixed,
                    because the invoice's Item Details table is 1702px of
                    columns and no fixed share is going to seat it.

                    JV uses the journal prototype beside a resizable source preview.
                    Its fields respond to the available pane width.

                    This is the rule hooks/pages/inbox/use-inbox-detail.ts
                    already encodes as `isTwoPane`; that module drives
                    components/inbox/detail, which this workspace replaced.
